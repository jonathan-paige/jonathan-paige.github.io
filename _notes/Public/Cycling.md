## 2022-01-31 - Mount Helena and back
Today I cycled to Mount Helena and back. It was a normal ride, apart from I almost died today.

On the way to the cafe there is a big downhill from the school to the roundabout. I was picking up speed and needing to get into the left-lane of the road and there was some weird traffic movements going on. As I was headed full speed downhill there was a large truck coming uphill in my lane. They pulled off the road, bouncing over the curb and I thought they were parking up to do some work. That wasn't the case. They kept slowly driving back into my lane, vering further and further into the road. I was staring them in the face and thought WTF you doin' mate? As I was mach II around the truck I saw what they were avoiding...A downed power line. Just in the nick of time I ducked to avoid being clothelined by the high voltage transmitter. Noggin saved.
